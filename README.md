# openpoll-miner-interface

Simple Angular 5 GUI for the [OpenPoll Mining Application](https://github.com/opoll/opollminer)

## How To Run
#### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) installed

Ensure that you have the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) installed globally

#### Start The Application
1.) Change to the current working directory you'd like to put the project.

2.) Run `git clone https://github.com/opoll/openpoll-miner-interface.git` to clone the repo

3.) Run `npm install` to install dependencies

4.) Run `npm start` or `ng serve` to run the application on http://localhost:4200/ (`npm start` just runs the application's start script which is defined as `ng serve` leading to the same result)
